## Formatting and linting
goto definition     `gd`

goto references     `gr`

code actions        `<leader>c`

trigger formatting  `<leader>f`


## Debuging with DAP
start debugger      `<leader>dc`

add breakpoint      `<leader>db`

terminate debugger  `<leader>dt`


## Python REPL
toggle REPL         `<leader>i`

restart REPL        `<leader>I` to restart the REPL

`+` serves as the "send to REPL" operator. That means we can use `++`
to send the current line to the REPL, and `+j` to send the current and the
following line to the REPL, like we would do with other vim operators.

## Autocompletion
Confirm completion  `<CR>`

select item         `<Tab>`/`<S-Tab>`
